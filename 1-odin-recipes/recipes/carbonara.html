        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            <br>Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.
            <br>Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat.
            <br>Cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
            <br>Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>

            <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet.
            <br>Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent.
            <br>Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
            <br>Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>

            <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti.
            <br>Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together.
            <br>Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set.
            <br>Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again.
            <br>Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>

            <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
        </ol>
